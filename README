## Deployment

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the React app in `my-app` and deploys the generated `build` folder to the `gh-pages` branch on pushes to `main`.

Local build & preview:

```bash
# install dependencies for the app
npm --prefix my-app ci

# build the app
npm --prefix my-app run build

# serve the build locally (optional: install serve globally `npm i -g serve`)
serve -s my-app/build -l 5000
```

If you use Netlify or Vercel, set the build command to `npm run build` inside the `my-app` folder and publish directory to `build`.
